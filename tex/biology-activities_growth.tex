\section{Growth}
Growth is a characteristic of living things. Growth is defined as the permanent increasing in size. Growth happens through cell division or cells getting larger. In most flowering plants, growth starts when the seed begins to germinate.

\subsection{Investigating Conditions Necessary for Seed Germination}
Seed germination is the development of a seed into a seedling. The changes that occur during seed germination include absorption of water through micropyle, bursting of testa, and emerging and elongation of the radicle. Then seed coat is discarded and cotyledons open out and begin to photosynthetize. Between the cotyledons, the plumule emerges and produces leaves. At this point, the young plant is called a seedling. The conditions necessary for seed germination include water, oxygen and optimum temperature.

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To investigate conditions necessary for seed germination.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Bean seeds, water, cotton wool, rubber stopper*, 4 test tubes*, cooking oil, boiling water, ice water (if available)

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Prepare 4 test tubes from syringes and label them 1, 2, 3, and 4.}
\item{Buy ice for ice water.}
\item{Boil water and let it cool to room temperature.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Place cotton wool at the bottom of each test tube.}
\item{Add a few seeds in each of the test tubes.}
\item{In test tube 1, add enough water to soak the cotton wool.}
\item{In test tube 2, add cool boiled water to flood the seeds; add small amount of oil to form a layer above the water.}
\item{In test tube 3, add ice water.}
\item{In test tube 4, do not add any water.}
\item{Keep the test tubes under these conditions for four days.}
\item{Record your observations every day and add water as needed to each tube, being sure to add only ice water to test tube 3.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
Only test tube 1 will show proper germination. The other test tubes will show little or no growth because they do not have the conditions necessary for germination.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later. No special waste disposal is required.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Why does test tube 2 use boiled water?}
\item{What conditions are missing from test tubes 3 and 4?}
\item{Describe the changes that occur during germination of bean seed.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
When planting seeds we must make sure that they recieve oxygen, water, and proper temperature for germination. Boiling removes the oxygen dissolved in water and the layer of oil in test tube 2 prevents oxygen from re-entering the water.

\subsection{Demonstration of Epigeal and Hypogeal Germination.}
Seed germination is the development of seed into a seedling. There are two types of germination: epigeal and hypogeal. Different seeds germinate differently depending on their classification group. Monocotyledons leave their cotyledons underground; this is called hypogeal germination. In dicotyledons the cotyledon emerges above the soil; this is called epigeal germination.

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To demonstrate epigeal and hypogeal germination.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Bean seeds, maize seeds, pots for sowing*, soil, and water

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Prepare 2 pots with soil for sowing seeds.}
\item{Collect maize and beans seeds.}
\item{Direct students to sow a few maize and bean seeds in two separate pots.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Observe the seedlings as they emerge from the soil.}
\item{Draw and label diagrams of maize and bean seedlings and classify as epigeal or hypogeal.}
\end{enumerate}

\label{fig:epigeal}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
In epigeal germination cotyledons are carried above the soil, as in the germination of bean seeds (dicotyledonous seeds). In hypogeal germination cotyledons remains underground, as in the germination of maize seeds(monocotyledonous seed).

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Define hypogeal and epigeal germination.}
\item{Distinguish between the germination of maize and bean seeds.}
\item{Draw and label maize seedling and bean seedling, identify the roots, shoots, and codyledons.}
\end{enumerate}
