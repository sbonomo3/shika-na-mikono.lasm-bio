\section{Cell Structure and Organization}
\subsection{Examining Animal and Plant Cells}
Plant and animal cells have similarities and differences. Plant cells have a cell wall which gives it a definite shape. Animal cells only have a cell membrane and thus a less rigid structure. Both types of cells have a nucleus which controls the function of the cell. Cells have different types of structures depending on their function in the organism.

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To differentiate various types of cells.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Water drop microscope*, plastic slides*, cover slips*, needle*, iodine solution*, Gentian Violet stain*, white tiles*, beaker*, petri dish*, onion, soft tissues from plants, blotting paper*, cheek cells, and razor blade/sharp knife, toothpick.

\subsubsection*{Hazards and Safety}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Gentian Violet can stain the skin and clothes.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect a few cheek cells from the inside of your cheek using a toothpick. Run a few drops of water over the toothpick onto a slide. Cover with a cover slip.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all materials}
\item{Peel a thin layer of epidermal cells from the onion and stain them using a few drops of iodine solution.}
\item{Cut a few thin cross sections from the stem and root using a sharp razor blade and place the specimens into a petri dish with water and a few drops of Gentian Violet.}
\item{Select the thinnest section of a stem and root and place the specimens on a slide.}
\item{Observe each specimen with the water drop microscope and draw what you see.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
The activity is intended to enable you to observe the structure of different plant cells.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.}
\item{Gentian Violet should be reused if possible; waste Gentian Violet should be disposed of in the pit latrine.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What is the function of epidermal cells of plants?}
\item{What differences did you observe between the plant and animal cells?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
While observing the animal and plant cells under a water drop microscope, you will only see the layout of the cells but not the details of different organelles as with a light microscope.
