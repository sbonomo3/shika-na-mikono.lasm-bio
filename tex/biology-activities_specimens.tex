\chapter{Biology Activities with Specimens}
There are a number of activities in O-Level Biology that require students to observe, identify, and classify different organisms. In this section, you will find a number of those activities and how to execute each in small groups with your students. You can refer to the previous chapter for collection and preservation ideas.

\section{Characteristics of Living Things}
There are 7 characteristics of living things; respiration, reproduction, excretion, irritability, movement, nutrition, and growth. The following activity can be done by students in small groups to show the characteristics of living things and enforce observation skills.

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To outline the characteristics of living things.}
\item{To differentiate between living and non-living things.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Materials}
plastic water bottles, traps, plastic cups, non-living things like a pen and a rock, and a cardboard box

\subsubsection*{Specimens}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Grasshopper, lizard, ant, or any other living things}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Hazards and Safety}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Some organisms may be poisonous and should be avoided.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Prepare cages and traps from the plastic water bottles. Purchase rat traps from the market.}
\item{Collect living and non-living things by using the traps and cages.}
\item{Put the collected organisms in cages, petri dishes, and plastic cups for students to observe.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Observe the specimens, draw and label each.}
\item{Record the characteristics of life you have observed in each specimen.}
\item{Categorize the specimens as living or non-living using your observations.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
Using the seven characteristics of life and observation skills, you should be able to determine which specimens are living and which are non-living. 

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect and clean all the used materials, storing items that will be used later. No special waste disposal required.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{How can you determine if a specimen is a living organism?}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
The collection of the specimens and thorough observation is very important. You may not see all of the characteristics in one day, but through observation students will have a general understanding of the characteristics of life.


\section{Introduction to Classification}
Because there are so many different living things in the world, biologists put these organisms into groups to make it easier to study and identify them. This process is called classification. Classification enables scientists to make predictions. When we know the characteristics of a group we can predict the features of an organism in that group. For example, an owl and chicken are both birds. If we know what the heart of a chicken looks like we can predict what the heart of an owl will look like even if we have not seen it.

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To group living things according to their similarities and differences.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Marker pen, cardboard, bread, and a tomato

\subsubsection*{Specimens}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Rat, ants, hibiscus or another type of flower, beetle, fish, worm}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Hazards and Safety}
\begin{itemize}
\item{When collecting and observing specimens, avoid dangerous animals like snakes, black ants, wasps, and bees. Stay away from poisonous plants like deadly nightshade and poisonous fungi like Amonita.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect different living things like fungi, plants of different shapes and sizes, and animals.}
\item{ Place a piece of moist bread near a window to culture bread mould.}
\item{ Cut a tomato in half and leave it overnight to prepare mucor.}
\item{Mount the different specimens on a piece of cardboard box and label each specimens with a single letter.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Display the specimens for observation.}
\item{Group the organisms based on their similarities and differences.}
\item{Classify the organisms, naming their Kingdom, Phylum/Division, and Class. Refer to the previous chapter as a guide.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
Students are expected to observe and group living things according to their similarities and differences.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all the used materials, storing items that will be used later. No special waste disposal is required.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Why do you think it is important to classify living things?}

\end{enumerate}


\section{Classification System}
Organisms are classified basing on two systems of classification which are artificial and natural systems of classification. Artificial system group organisms according to observable features. Eg. presence or absence of wings. Natural system group organisms according to external as well as internal features. Natural system is the best way of classifying living organisms.

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Hazards and Safety}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Take care of the poisonous organisms during collection of specimens.}
\item{Be careful with the preservatives as they can irritate or damage your skin.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect varieties of specimens (live or preserved).}
\item{Collect pictures showing variety of reptiles.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Display the collected specimens by mounting them in cardboard boxes. Label them with letters using a marker pen .}
\item{Display the pictures showing varieties of reptiles.}
\item{Observe the external features from each specimen collected and group them.}
\item{Discuss on how to group organisms basing on Artificial and Natural system.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
Students are expected to group organisms by using the observable features and the behaviour of the organisms. They also need to understand how the internal features help to give a better way grouping organisms.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Remove all unwanted materials left after observation.}
\item{Return specimens on specimen's bottles for preservation.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What are the differences between artificial and natural systems of classification?}
\item{What are the advantages and disadvantages of the two systems of classification?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
Classification should be based on features which show evolutionary relationships. Otherwise few features and external features may lead to the wrong grouping of organisms.

\section{Investigation of Division Angiospermophyta}

\subsection{Identification of the Reproductive Parts of the Flowers}
Angiosperms develop specialized structures called flowers used for reproduction. A flower is a modified part of a stem in which the primary sex organs are found. A flower has the following parts; peduncle, receptacle, calyx (sepal), corolla (petals). The male reproductive organ called the stamen consists of filament and anthers which form pollen grains. The female reproductive organs consisting of an ovary, style and stigma. Hibiscus flowers are bisexual because they have both male and female organs in one flower. Some pawpaw flowers have either female or male flowers and are referred to as unisexual flowers. Plants with both male and female flowers on the same plant are called monoecious like maize. Plants with male and female flowers on separate plants are deciduous like a pawpaw plant.

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}

\section{Dissection of a Rat}
The body contain different system which are vital to our daily life. They perform different important functions inside us. One of the systems is the digestive system. Our digestive system breaks down large food particles into pieces that are small enough to pass through the gut wall and dissolve into the blood. In order to see the digestive system inside the body and how it works we need to dissect a mammal.
Dissections may work well as a demonstration first by the teacher and then later performed by the students on their own in small groups.

\item{After catching a rat in the trap, kill it by dipping the trap together with the rat in a bucket full of water for 5-10 minutes.}
\item{When the rat is dead, add 3 spoons of bleach to the bucket full of water and wait for 10 minutes so that the bleach kills the micro organisms.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Remove the rat from the bucket.}
\item{Lay the freshly killed rat on the dissecting board ventral side (abdomen) facing upward and pin it using needles or thorns from acacia plant.}
\item{Using a clothes pin, lift the skin of the abdomen and using a knife or a razor blade, make a longitudinal cut/slit at the centre of the abdomen.}
\item{Extend the cut with a knife up to the thoracic cavity and make an incision towards the limbs.}
\item{Using a piece of wood or clothes pin, separate and stretch the skin from the lower body wall.}
\item{Pin the folds of skin on the dissection tray using acacia thorns or needles.}
\item{Cut the body wall on either side of the mid line in order to observe different internal organs. Do not cut too deep otherwise you will damage the underlying organs.}
\item{Open the thoracic cavity by cutting through intercoastal muscles and rib cage.}
\item{Observe the internal digestive system clearly and use the provided chart/diagram of a human digestive system to compare the structures.}
